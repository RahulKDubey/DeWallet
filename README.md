For using it directly by this link: https://walletdapp.netlify.app/
Just install Ganache to your system and open the app then click on QUICKSTART.
Now move on to this website link and it will show your account is connected and provider is Ganache. 
Good, now you can use it.. 




 
For cloning it to vscode : 
clone the repo.

npm install on terminal.

npm start on the terminal in the client directory

if any error shows up then run audit fix --force command (see the syntax correctly on the terminal it will be displayed).

then again run npm start .

(Note: You might need to do the audit fix more than 1 time and it will work then).

Open Ganache and refresh the local host , it will show now that Provider Ganache is connected
